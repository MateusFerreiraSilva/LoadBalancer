In order to build the program your can run the command:
    make LoadBalancer

When you run this program it will read a file in the same directory named "config", make sure you have it before you run this program (This project already come with a default config file).

The configuration file is organized as follows:

routing-method: (RoundRobin or LeastConnected)
servers: N (Number of servers)
(N Servers IP address and port number separated by space)
debugMode: (Boolean value indicatin if the debug is enabled)

After this your can run it typing:
    ./LoadBalancer

If you want to test the LoadBalancer, you can run the test serve that comes with this project by typing: "node server.js", and after this you will need to input the port where this server will run, and of course you will need node installed on your machine.
